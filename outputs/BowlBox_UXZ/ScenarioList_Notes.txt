Bowl means boundary conditions on all x-lower,upper, y-lower,upper, z-lower is FluxConst=0, so 'bocale' no water can flow out of the domains, which is a major and unphysical constrains. Especially if we look at simulations K36e-3 (L2 vs L2d) the water flow in z direction on the lower layer is 0, and reaches instead higher velocities in XY direction respect to upper layer.

No significant gain in computational cost with TimeStepGrowth.
